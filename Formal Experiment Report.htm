<p>
    The web site <a href="http://defacto.at/">
    <code>defacto.at</code></a> belongs to APA De Facto, a
    daughter company of APA, the Austria Press Agency. The De Facto web
    site is an interface to an online archive of more than 70 million
    documents from over 190 sources (mostly newspaper and newswire
    articles).
</p>

<p>
    The APA De Facto web site is aimed at media researchers wishing to
    stay abreast of developments and trends in the media or to research
    background information on a particular topic.
</p>

<p>
    APA De Facto would like to simulate new customers registering for the
    web site and performing a few typical tasks. A series of formative and
    summative tests with novice users were planned to help APA De Facto
    redesign their site to be more intuitive to first time users.
    Since the web site is in German, the studies were
    carried out in German with German-speaking test users.
</p>


<h2>3 Test Methodology</h2>

<p>
    {Decribe the test plan and formal experiment methodology
    in general terms.}
</p>


<p>
    The web site <a href="http://defacto.at/">
    <code>defacto.at</code></a>
    was tested as part of a series of usability studies...
</p>


<h3>3.1 Test Procedure</h3>


<p>
    This test, the initial benchmark test, BM1, gathered
    concrete performance and rating data from the initial version
    of the web site. It was run as a formal experiment of
    a single interface (summative evaluation).
    More details on the methods of usability testing can
    be found in Keith Andrews' lecture notes
    [<a href="#ref-Andrews2011">Andrews, 2011</a>].
    The structure of this report broadly follows the Common
    Industry Format (CIF) [<a href="#ref-ISO2006">ISO, 2006</a>].
</p>


<p>
    {Test Design}
</p>

<p>
    {Test table with the mapping of test cases to test users.}
</p>

<p>
    {If you are testing, say, four different interfaces, include
    one screenshot of each interface.}
</p>


<p>
    {Description of the test data.
    What data was measured or gathered?}
</p>


<p>
    One pilot user and 16 real test users were recruited. Users were given
    a fictitious identity to register for the web site. Users then
    performed a series of typical tasks. Performance data and successful
    completion data was collected for each task. At the end of the test,
    each user was interviewed to gather feedback. Finally, a feedback
    questionnaire was administered to gather subjective rating data from
    each user.
</p>

<p>
    The data was analysed to determine mean and standard deviation for the
    benchmark BM1 test. The results from BM2 (after a web site redesign)
    will later be compared with the results from BM1.
</p>


<h2>3.2 Test Users</h2>

<!-- Describe the selection process for test users. -->

<p>
    Friends and colleagues were recruited for each study, with the
    following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Experienced users of computers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Experienced users of the web.
    </li>
    <li>
        Native speakers of German
        (or excellent command of German if non-native).
    </li>
    <li>
        Age 18 or over.
    </li>
</ul>


<!-- Textual summary of the important background infos.  -->

<p>
    Summary of the important background infos. Sixteen university
    students volunteered for this study (12 men and 6 women). They ranged
    in age from 18 to 36 (median 22) years. The average web use for the
    participants was 8.4 (median 5) hours per week, 83% used the web a few
    times per week or more.
</p>


<!-- Tabular summary of all the background data. -->

<p>
    Now include a tabular summary of <em>all</em> of the data from the
    background questionnaires, <em>including</em> the domain-specific
    questions. If the table is too wide, break it into several tables.
</p>

<p>
    Replace the real names of your users with IDs TP1 to TP16 (say)
    and first name aliases.
    The mapping of IDs and aliases to real names is included in
    Appendix <a href="#AppUserMaterials">B</a>.

</p>

<p>
    The user was given the task before recording started so they could get familiar with it.
</p>

<p>
    The facilitator then instructed the user to start the test.
</p>

<h3>3.4 Training</h3>


<!-- A description of the training (if any) to be given -->

<!-- The first question is always "What did you think?",  -->
<!-- or "How was it?", an open question to encourage the user  -->
<!-- to speak freely.  -->

<!-- Next, you ask a series of general questions prepared in   -->
<!-- advance for every test user. -->

<!-- Finally, you ask any questions which may have arisen -->
<!-- during the test with that particular test user. -->

<h3>4.2 Task Performance</h3>


<p>
    Tabular summaries of the times for each task (in seconds) and any
    other measures (number of clicks, etc.). Include the mean and
    standard deviation.
</p>

<p>
    {These are essentially HTML table versions
    of the performance data from your spreadsheet.}
</p>


<h3>4.3 Subjective Ratings</h3>


<p>
    A tabular summary of the responses to the feedback questionnaire,
    including the average and standard deviation.
</p>

<p>
    The neutral scale in the original feedback questionnaire is replaced
    by a weighted scale between 6 (best) and 0 (worst). The
    users' responses are then entered into the columns on the right.
</p>

<p>
    The average and standard deviation is calculated for each
    question and entered in the columns on the far right.
</p>

<p>
    So that the reader can see the overall results at a glance, the point
    on the scale closest to the average is marked highlighted through the
    style sheet. Here is an example.
